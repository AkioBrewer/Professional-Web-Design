                <h3>Website Design</h3>
                <p>
                  A stunning website can rejuvenate your business and
                  distinguish you as a key player in your industry. At Akio
                  Brewer Web Design, our team of talented Atlanta website
                  designers takes a holistic approach to each project. The first
                  step is getting to know you and what makes your business tick.
                  Before we begin conceptualizing layout and design, there are
                  several angles to consider such as, target audience, marketing
                  strategy, growth direction and competition comparison. A
                  comprehensive understanding of your business model can assure
                  that our designs will have purpose and direction. By combining
                  usability with elegance and creativity, your website will
                  entice and assure the audience you're an authority in your
                  industry.

                <h3>Website Maintenance</h3>
                <p>
                  Our job is simple: keep your website up-to-date, secure, up
                  and running, and bug-free. Standard maintenance on your
                  website keeps it looking great, and running fast as we monitor
                  for uptime and performance including daily backup and hourly
                  monitoring. We can also consult, plan and strategize with you
                  based on what isnâ€™t working well for your website from broken
                  links to outdated content to make larger updates and even
                  revamp it as needed.
